# Sorting Algorithms

list sorted alphabetically by algorithm name

## Bubble Sort 40k

- C = 2,413ms
- CPP = 5,151ms
- javascript = 3,039ms
- cPython = 212,344ms (almost 4 mins)
- Pypy = 5,029ms

## Insertion Sort 40k

- C = 318ms
- CPP = 309ms
- javascript = 683ms
- cPython = 92,213ms (1 and a half min)
- Pypy = 581ms

## MinMax Selection Sort 40k
Maybe another name. I just made it up

- C = 490ms (45% better speed than standard selection sort)

## Merge Sort 40k

- C = 6ms (25% better speed than standard merge sort)
- CPP = 11ms
- javascript = 38ms
- cPython = 306ms
- Pypy = 269ms

## Selection Sort 40k

- C = 710ms
- CPP = 682ms
- javascript = 1,630ms
- cPython = 8,357ms
- Pypy = 1,001ms

languages in process: C, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Elixir, CSharp
languages to future: Haskell, OCaml, Nim, Zig, Golang, Java, Kotlin, Clojure
etc: Julia, Kotlin, Pascal
